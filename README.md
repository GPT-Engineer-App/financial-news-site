# financial-news-site

Create a simple news site where a writer can publish their articles about the latest news in the financial markets. 

Make it look like the Financial times. The user (the writer) should be able to:
- Create an article (with an image, a title, ingress, and free text)
- The articles should be listed, newest first, with their image at the top, then the title, ingress, and the free text
- The readers of the news site should be able to search and filter the articles on the news site, and click on the articles to see a bigger picture and a full article view.
